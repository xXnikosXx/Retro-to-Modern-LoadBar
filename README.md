# "Retro to Modern" Loading Bar
A CSS3 (no JS) Loading Bar for Websites (or other HTML supporting tools using HTML & CSS like ElectronJS). The animation starts like a Windows95 loading bar
and quickly transforms in a modern-looking spinner, before the entire overlay fades away, revealing the actual website below.
